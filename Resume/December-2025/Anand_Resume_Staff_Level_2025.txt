Combines deep systems expertise with hands-on leadership to deliver business-critical platforms at scale.


Work Experience
------------------------

Lead Software Engineer
Clear
09/2023 - Present | Bengaluru, India

Technical Leadership & Architecture
- Grew and lead engineering team ~4x (from ~5 to ~20 engineers) while architecting Clear's global E-Invoicing platform, processing 100M+ invoices monthly per country, with architecture designed to scale linearly as new markets launch across EU, MEA, and SEA regions.
- Designed multi-tenant, country-agnostic microservices architecture enabling multiple countries to operate on shared infrastructure while maintaining regulatory isolation—reducing infrastructure costs and time-to-market for new country launches from months to weeks.
- Developed rapid country launch framework leveraging LLM-assisted automation, reducing country deployment timeline to under 2 weeks. Successfully executed launches in Belgium, Germany, and UAE using this playbook, with 40+ country rollouts planned.

Platform Innovation & Organizational Impact
- Created reusable async metrics publishing framework for real-time workflow observability, subsequently adopted by multiple teams across Clear, establishing an organization-wide standard for service monitoring and dashboards.
- Re-architected GST orchestration flow handling ~200M+ invoices/month—redesigned async flows and pod allocation, achieving 70% higher throughput with reduced infrastructure costs, eliminating OOM errors and slowness causing timeouts at peak load, reducing failure rates from 10% to <0.1%.
- Established technical leadership practices including architectural review processes, code quality standards, and mentorship programs for 10+ engineers, elevating overall engineering excellence across distributed teams.


Software Development Engineer
Amazon
04/2019 - 03/2023 | Gurugram, India

Vendor Inbound Tracking Platform (Lead Engineer)
- Led design and development of real-time vendor shipment tracking platform, replacing manual processes that took 10+ days with near real-time visibility, enabling faster dispute resolution and improving experience for Amazon's global vendor ecosystem.
- Architected end-to-end system: event-driven ingestion pipeline (SNS/SQS with EC2 workers), serverless API layer (Lambda + API Gateway), and React frontend via CloudFront.
- Solved Lambda cold start latency by moving database connection establishment to initialization phase, reducing P99 from 5+ seconds to under 1 second—pattern later reused across other projects including Amazon Go.
- Evaluated multiple database options (SQL, DynamoDB, DocumentDB) and selected DocumentDB for flexible schema supporting evolving access patterns.
- Led EU internationalization by solving cross-regional integration challenges, developing region-agnostic components, and executing rollouts with EU teams.

Amazon Go - Associate Management Platform (Greenfield)
- Designed end-to-end associate management platform from scratch: intervention portal, performance tracking with randomized assessments, and personalized training assignments.
- Built serverless full-stack (S3, CloudFront, Cognito, Lambda). CI/CD pipeline reduced deployments from 2 days to 1 hour.


Software Engineer
Reliance Jio
07/2018 - 04/2019

- Developed automation framework for web-based portal operations, achieving 70% reduction in execution time and establishing foundation for continuous testing practices.
